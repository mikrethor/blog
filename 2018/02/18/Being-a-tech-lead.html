<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost one year ago, my client needed a Tech Lead in one of it&#8217;s development team.
In fact they needed someone that would help to get their regulatory project back on the right track.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was not easy at first but what an achievement the team has done from this moment.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="the_project">The project</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I arrived in the team, the status was the following :</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The team used scrum but was not able to deliver an increment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The team was not in the same place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some team member were angry at each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every developer deployed in test environment without pulling the code from the VCS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was no unit test, all the testing was made by hand</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First thing first, I talked to each team member to clearly identify all the problems in the team.
It could seem not important but it&#8217;s something that had to be done to help team member to move on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From that point, we had to get some quick win to help team member to get back their confidence in them and in the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do that, I helped the team to kill some bad habits by using the CI server to help us deploy our webapp directly from the VCS.
It helped us to be sure that the code deployed was the one in the VCS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After that, we started to use pull requests to review each line of code being commit to the development branch.
Being peer reviewed took some time but is now part of our daily routine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately for us, those few moves helped the QA tester to properly and rapidly test.
Improving the feedback loop had a good impact on the webapp quality and the development team started to deliver the increment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these victories helped me work on improving the development speed and quality by putting in place proper unit testing.
Exhorting the team member to use unit tests instead of locally deploy the webapp and test it by hand was quite a challenge.
I thought it was pretty straightforward for a developer to understand that doing unit test reduce development time.
Especially when deploying the webapp locally takes a few minutes but it seems that some old habits die hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we had to change some team members. In fact, I don&#8217;t know if we can speak about team member in such case because they didn&#8217;t really followed the team guidelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In such conditions, we managed to succeed the first webapp delivery to production with an acceptable quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My job has become a lot easier since then.
I have focused on improving team efficiency and some team member have taken good habits.
We have managed to improve the code coverage from 0 to 50%.
And with this the team has the proper tools and the confidence to refactor the code when needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s quite an achievement from our starting point and I am proud of what the team has achieved.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="the_role">The role</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For me a Tech Lead is a developer who is in charge of leading the development team.
It&#8217;s really important that the Tech Lead develops because without that it&#8217;s not possible to have the team confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be good in the job, a Tech Lead has to divide his time between :</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>coding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>motivating the team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting/organizing the team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>innovation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The balance is sometimes hard to achieve. But when you move away from this repartition, don&#8217;t forget to get back to these ratios
 as soon as possible or you will do a poor job as a Tech Lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On my current project, I was too much in the code and it prevented me to see some member problem soon enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Tech Lead who doesn&#8217;t code can&#8217;t be a Teach Lead because he won&#8217;t identify what the team is going through.
I mean a Tech Lead has to understand the team context and improve this context to facilitate the team work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, it represents 30% of my time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="motivating_the_team">Motivating the team</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Motivating the team means helping the team to be motivated.
It means :
- removing the problem
- reducing the development difficulties
- helping having a good atmosphere</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It takes approximately 30% of my time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="supporting_organizing_the_team">Supporting / organizing the team</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supporting and organizing the team is the same in this case because the goal is to encourage team members to discuss among themselves.
It helps improving knowledge and collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It also takes approximately 30% of my time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="innovation">Innovation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Innovation could seem irrelevant but it&#8217;s a part of team motivation because without innovation the team will
 loose motivation to improve things and innovation is a way to improve development time and quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess you have already found that it takes me 10% of my time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="one_last_thing">One last thing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A take lead can&#8217;t do his job properly, without having a team ready to listen. My job on this project would have been a
 lot harder if no one had listen and started to embrace the change.</p>
