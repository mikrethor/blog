<p>I am a Java developer with a 13+ years experience consulting for many different customers in France and Canada.</p>

<p>I like to work with Java or Kotlin in a Jakarta EE or Spring Boot context.</p>

<p>I am interested in stuff around DevOps, CI/CD, Testing, Security, ...</p>

<p>Most of all, I like to talk about tech stuff around a beer mostly during our Montreal Jug where I am a co-organizer.</p>

<p>On the personal side, I have three boys and a wife. They are my number one priority. And to have energy to do that, I run with a goal in mind : finishing a marathon in less than 4 hours.</p>
